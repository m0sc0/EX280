* self-provisioner: A user that can create their own projects.
* cluster-admin:    A super-user that can perform any action in any project. When bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over quota and every action on every resource in the project.

basic-user: 	  A user that can get basic information about projects and users.
cluster-status:   A user that can get basic cluster status information.
edit:             A user that can modify most objects in a project but does not have the power to view or modify roles or bindings.(can create new-app)
